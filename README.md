## Introduction

###
We will try a hybrid detection method using CNNs as they are easy to train, as well as a few other approaches. This includes ViTs and Encoder-Decoder + XGBoost/CNN Architectures as preprocessing.

The code is structured in:
- models.py - contains the code for each model as well as a wrapper function.
